## Configurations

### Linux

#### i3

My i3 window manager setup is designed for efficiency and aesthetics. Enjoy a tiling window manager that maximizes your productivity with a minimalistic look.

#### Terminals

Customizations for your terminal emulator, ensuring a smooth command-line experience.

#### Rofi

Rofi is the launcher, switcher, and dmenu replacement that I use to quickly navigate through applications and system settings. It's highly customizable and integrates seamlessly with my i3 setup.

### Neovim

My neovim configuration is tailored for web development, with robust support for Svelte and TypeScript. Plugins, key mappings, and color schemes are carefully chosen to enhance your coding experience.

### Web Development

For web development, I've fine-tuned my configurations to cater specifically to Svelte and TypeScript projects. Whether you're building a frontend application or a full-stack solution, these settings will boost your development workflow.
